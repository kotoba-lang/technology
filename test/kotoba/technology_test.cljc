;; This namespace was `.clj` until 2026-08-18 — `(slurp (io/resource …))` —
;; and through it `kotoba.iso3166`, which requires this, and everything that
;; wanted either. The first fix was a `:cljs` branch reading `resources/`
;; relative to the working directory. **That was wrong and was measured
;; wrong the same day**: iso3166's suite under nbb produced 159 errors,
;; every one this registry coming back nil because nbb's cwd was iso3166's
;; root. A portability fix that works only while you are the root project is
;; not one.
;;
;; So the registry is compiled in. There is no read, so there is no read that
;; can fail, so the `nil-means-nobody-could-look` tests that guarded the old
;; path are gone with the path — keeping them would have been a check with no
;; failure mode. What is tested instead is the failure mode that now exists:
;; the generated projection drifting from the EDN a human edits.
