;; The portable suite on nbb — no build step, no JVM.
;;
;; This file is the whole point of the `.cljc` conversion. Reader
;; conditionals that are never evaluated under `:cljs` are not portability;
;; they are the appearance of it, and a `:cljs` branch nothing runs is a
;; check that cannot fail. Run it from the repo root, where the `:cljs`
;; resource reader looks for `resources/`:
;;
;;   nbb --classpath src:test test/run_portable.cljs
;;
;; Every `deftest`-bearing portable namespace must be named BOTH in the
;; require and in `run-tests`: requiring registers the vars, only
;; `run-tests` runs them, and a runner naming a subset prints the same
;; `Ran N tests` shape as one naming all of them.
