;; ## Why embed at all
;;
;; There is no portable `io/resource`. The `:cljs` reader this replaced read
;; `resources/<path>` relative to the PROCESS's working directory, which is
;; right when this library is the root project and wrong the moment it is a
;; dependency — measured 2026-08-18, when `kotoba.iso3166`'s suite ran under
;; nbb and produced 159 errors, all of them this registry coming back nil
;; because nbb's cwd was iso3166's root and not this one.
;;
;; The EDN file stays the source of truth and the thing a human edits. The
;; generated namespace is a projection of it, checked by `--check`, and it is
;; what the library actually reads — so there is no runtime file access, no
;; cwd assumption, and it works in a browser too.
